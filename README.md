# Sales project for the EAD course

  If your maven does not work make maven clean and maven compile
  
  Changes: Jdbc Pattern was removed with Spring Jpa. Entity classes was removed by single Employee

  # Please create a database named "employees" first

  I did not include database backup because it will create it automatically after uncommenting "# spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create"
